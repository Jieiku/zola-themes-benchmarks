## Zola Themes Benchmarks - [click here for wider page](https://github.com/Jieiku/zola-themes-benchmarks/blob/main/README.md)

This is a quick overview showing which Zola themes are fast, lightweight, security oriented, and follow modern web standards.

Last Updated: Aug 10 2024

- KB: Kilobytes Blog Index (lower is better)
- GL: [Google Lighthouse](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) Average Score (higher is better)
- YL: [Yellow Lab Tools](https://yellowlab.tools/) Average Score (higher is better)
- MO: [Mozilla Observatory](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/) Score (higher is better)

Themes are sorted by Lighthouse, YellowLabTools, and Observatory ratings, themes with Search feature are at the top.

You may wonder, why check the Mozilla Observatory rating on a demo site?

If any Javascript used by the theme is improperly structured/implemented, then it is impossible to enforce a strict CSP without also breaking the Javascript features (this is particularly true of unsafe-inline). We can surmise that any themes with a high mozilla observatory rating (and the js features still work) do not have any obvious javascript issues.

If you host your site or theme on netlify then implementing a CSP is simple, just include a [netlify.toml file (headers section)](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge/blob/master/netlify.toml).

If you host your site or theme on cloudflare pages then implementing a CSP is simple, just include a [_headers file](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge/blob/master/static/_headers).
